# OptimalBinarySearchTree

This code features an optimal binary search function. In the dictionary.txt file, each line contains two elements: the first element is a number representing the word's frequency of occurrence, and the second element is the word itself. Only words with a frequency greater than 50 000 are selected, as I only worked with those. Additionally, the OBST (Optimal Binary Search Tree) was implemented based on the theory and pseudocode described in the book "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.
